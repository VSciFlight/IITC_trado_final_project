<h2>Background</h2>
Trado is an e-commerce website used for suppliers and stores. Stores can buy products which are suggested by the suppliers on the site.
The suppliers are anonymous so there is no former advantage<br>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

    <li>Jenkins</li>
    <li>Reporting Service (Allure)</li>
    <li>Pytest</li>
</ul>
I also received scopes to focus on:

<h4>After wandering and testing the site I do NOT suggest to publish it due a big number of failed tests</h4>
