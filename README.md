<h2>Background</h2>
Trado is an e-commerce website used for suppliers and stores. Stores can buy products which are offered by the suppliers on the site.
The suppliers are anonymous so there is no former advantage. <br>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
The main objective of this project was to test the site and test processes in the website itself in any way I find it relevant.
<br>
I decided to run UI and Content tests manually, and Functional tests automatically. 
<br>
I was given a list of techniques I must use and requirements and had to handle them.
<br>
<h4>Tools requirements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Selenium</li>
    <li>DB</li>
    <li>Jenkins</li>
    <li>Reporting Service (Allure)</li>
    <li>Pytest</li>
</ul>
I also received scopes to focus on:
<ul>
    <li>Homepage</li>
    <li>Contact</li> 
    <li>Footer</li>
    <li>Login & Register</li>
    <li>Product</li>
    <li>Search</li>
    <li>Personal Area</li>
    <li>Checkout Process</li>
</ul>
<br>
This is the project structure. At its end.

The orange frame is the main directory. <br>
* requirements.txt included the packages needed to run this project <br>
* src/locators included the locators of each page. locators_index.py is the file which holds all the locators classes. <br>
* src/pages includes the functions which are relevant for each page. <br>
* src/utils.py includes the utility and common packages for the project <br>
* tests directory includes all the tests <br>
* reports includes the reports for allure that are generated by the pytest package <br>
* allure-report is a folder dedicated for allure to read the reports and generate comprehensive report <br>

<strong>Packages Used:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Selenium</li>
    <li>Pytest - testing framework</li>
    <li>Allure - reporting</li>
    <li>Pymongo - database</li>
    <li>Pandas - tables utility</li>
</ul>
<strong>External Tools:</strong>

    <li>Jenkins</li>
    <li>Google Sheets</li>
    <li>Canva</li>
</ul>



<h2> Conclusions </h2>
In total there were 88 tests, in which 51 automated tests ran.

<div>
Severity: <br>
Critical - Any bug that is causing a crash or blank page in the site <br>
High - Any bug that doesn't function as it should be and is important <br>
Medium - Any bug that doesn't function as it should be and its importance is quite low <br>
Low - Minor bugs and content bugs

<br>
As shown in the graph, there are a lot of bugs and test which didn't pass. 
There is no validation where it should or even must have one. The basic business of creating a user doesn't require much validation - all you need is a 5 digits code which sent to a "phone" number.
In a wide look my details are protected ONLY by a code that sent to my phone <a href="https://teampassword.com/blog/how-does-one-time-password-hijacking-work">which also can be hijacked</a>.

<h4>After wandering and testing the site I do NOT suggest to publish it due a big number of failed tests</h4>
